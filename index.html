              <p style="text-align: justify;">
                The Department of Family and Community Resource Management, formerly known as Home Management, is one of the pioneers in India offering specialization at Undergraduate, Post Graduate and Doctorate level. The Department launched a specialization Programme, leading to B.Sc. Degree in the Academic Year 1953-54. Master’s Degree Programme was initiated in the year 1962-63. During the academic year 1978-79, the Department launched its Doctorate Degree Programme. The Master’s Degree Programme received a boost in the year 1992-93 by offering to areas of specialization namely: (i) Family Economics and Resource Management (ii) Housing, Interiors and Household Equipment. Special efforts were made to enhance the scope for academic development and commercial application hence the later was developed into a more focused specialization, and was reframed as “Interior Design”. The need to create vocation based Programme at Bachelor’s level necessitated enhancement in professional skills and competencies amongst the students. In the year 2003-04 the Department, thus, introduced two streams in its UG Programme titled as (i) Interior Design and (ii) Hospitality Management. The Department received National recognition from the Government of India and was awarded the “Technical Backup Support Unit” under the Ministry of Non-Renewable Energy Sources, from 1986 to 2001. In the year 2012, Honours Degree Programme was started in the Faculty. The Department also strengthened its courses for vocationalisation under the Honours Degree Program. In the year 2015-16, it has launched honours Degree Programme exclusively in “Interior Design”. The Department had initiated, managed and started a special Post Graduate Diploma in “Hotel Interiors” under the banner of Institute of Hotel Management and Catering Technology (HMCT) since the year 2014-15, which is now offered under the Department. Recently, with an aim to generate more employment opportunities for Post Graduate Students of the specialization 'Family Economics and Resource Management', it was modified into 'Hospitality and Resource Management' in the Academic Year 2019-2020.

                  made my two-year MSc journey easier. It has excellent courses with lovely teachers, which helped

                  I just completed my three-year Degree course in Department of Family and Community
                  Resource Management. As I started attending regular classed I can realize the importance of
                  these course and Department. All this was possible only because of my all teachers they
                  teach me many things such as communication skills, inventive thinking, how to deal with
                  problems, how to be creative and many more things. In this Department I have created
                  many memorable memories which I can never forget in my life. I always miss each and every
                  class of the Department, all activities and trip of SY, youth festival, all days like traditional,
                  group. Hospitality students and interior students, we share a very strong bond in this
